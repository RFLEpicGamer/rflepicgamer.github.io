## Why Microsoft, Why?
1st they discontinued windows 8.1 in 2023, and now, they are now discontinuing windows subsystem android? why are they doing this? did microsoft become google now? discontinuing good stuff for no good reason?

## Windows 11 sucks now
Windows 11 is no longer my favorite windows because of this, i permanently switched to linux with wayland on it, i also hope that microsoft reverses this decision
